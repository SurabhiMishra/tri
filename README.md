## Quick start

This is a normal flutter app. Please follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).


## Inspiration

- In today's day and time, there are a lot emerging opportunities for women. But they are not well curated and the deadlines are often missed by most people.
- It has also been found out through surveys that in the cases of sexual harassment at workplace or organization, nearly 3 in 4 claims of harassment go unreported
- More than 38% of women have experienced sexual harassment at work.
Its as though, women have learnt to suffer silently as they fear retaliation or worse- not believing in their claims. All they need is a platform to give them VOICE
All these problems led us to think of creating our App- EmpowHER.

## What it does
#### It has the following features:
> **Opportunities and Resources** : 
  - User can get all the information about upcoming opportunities and recommended resources along the links to their website to get more info, deadlines to apply and description
  - User can also upload details about new opportunities or resources and earn  points.

> **Find a mentor**:
 - Users can view different mentors(from a variety of organizations) and book an appointment with them for a minimal charge.

> **A Safe Space** : 
  - Users will a get a platform to write(Either anonymously/not) about any kind of gender inequality or sexist experience they faced in their respective organization.
  - This way they can make their story reach out to a large number of people and get their support.
  - Users can read other’s story and can Upvote it.

> **Redeem Points**:
  - Users will be able to earn points by uploading new valid resources and opportunities on the app.
  - They can redeem these points to buy things from the in-app store.
  - The store include gifts like books by powerful women, empowerment stickers, t-shirts etc.

## How we built it
- We built our app using **Flutter**, **Firebase**, **Visual Studio Code**, **Android Studio**.
- We collaborated using **Git** on **GitHub**.

## Challenges we ran into
- Since all of us are working online and are not at the same place, collaborating virtually was a tough task.
- The designing of our app is a little unconventional for default flutter widgets like listTile, so tweaking it took us some time.
- Making the UX really user friendly was a time consuming process and took a lot of brainstorming.

## Accomplishments
- _**Runner-up for the 'Best Hack to Support Women' category**_
- Overcoming all the challenges mentioned above, we were able to complete a working flutter App with a user friendly interface in the given limited amount of time.

## What's next
> **Future Scope:**
  - Implement an ml model which will suggest current opportunities available based on previous registrations made by the user.
  - Collaborate with Women Empowering Organizations and conduct various  events for women in tech.
  - User can fill a form to be a mentor and we will verify it in backend.
  - In future we plan to start our own Scholarship to support women.

> **Future Monetization Plan:**
  - We intended to generate revenue through the app by charging some amount of money for the mentor session from the users.
  - We can also generate revenue by putting in advertisements (of sanitary pads, women healthcare products etc.)
  - A part of the revenue will be used to buy the gifts in the redeem store to keep our idea running
